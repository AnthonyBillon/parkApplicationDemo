# parkApplicationDemo
Simple demo of a responsive parking application (university project), with only frontend. I made some shitty code by place (by modifying the text content directly in the elemnts for example) but I'll update it later
Using ES6 (and some ES7) functionnalities. Internet Explorer 6 will not be able to display it, but nobody care, here a link to download Firefox : [here](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/download/thanks/ "Firefox")
